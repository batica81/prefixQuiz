# prefixQuiz

This is a game to help you learn country prefixes.
It has two modes, guess the country and guess the prefix.

The list was taken from: https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/terrestrial/fmd/Pages/call_sign_series.aspx and modified a little bit.

App is available for use or install at: https://prefixquiz.cinamontest.duckdns.org/

TODO:

- Add weights for actual occurrences of prefixes

# prefixQuiz

This is a game to help you learn country prefixes.
It has three modes: guess the country, guess the prefix and prefix lookup.

The list was taken from: https://www.iaru-r1.org/about-us/committees-and-working-groups/hf-committee-c4/documents-hf/ and modified a little bit.

There may be some bugs and inconsistencies, so please report if you find any.

App is available for use or install at: https://prefixquiz.pages.dev/
